**Bitmaps**
Redis bitmaps are not a separate data type but a set of operations applied to the String data type, treating it as a bit vector. This approach allows efficient handling of bit-level operations and is particularly useful for scenarios where compact storage and fast bitwise operations are essential.

- **Bitwise Operations**: Redis allows operations such as setting, getting, and manipulating individual bits within a string.
- **Use Cases**: Bitmaps are effective for tasks like maintaining set memberships, representing object permissions, or tracking user activities.

**Bit Operations**

- **SETBIT**: Sets a bit at a specified offset to either 0 or 1.
- **GETBIT**: Retrieves the value of a bit at a given offset.
- **BITOP**: Performs bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) between different strings.
- **BITCOUNT**: Counts the number of bits set to 1 in a string or within a specified range.
- **BITPOS**: Finds the position of the first bit set to 0 or 1 in a string or within a specified range.

**Use Cases**

- **Membership Tracking**: Efficiently manage membership statuses or preferences.
- **Permission Systems**: Represent and check permissions using individual bits.
- **Activity Tracking**: Record user interactions or system events with minimal overhead.

**Example**

Suppose you're tracking pings from sensors on cyclists during a race. Each sensor is represented by a unique ID, and you want to know if a sensor has pinged within a specific hour.

```shell
SETBIT pings:2024-01-01-00:00 123 1
GETBIT pings:2024-01-01-00:00 123
GETBIT pings:2024-01-01-00:00 456
```

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

client.setbit('pings:2024-01-01-00:00', 123, 1, (err, reply) =>
	console.log(reply)
);
client.getbit('pings:2024-01-01-00:00', 123, (err, reply) =>
	console.log(reply)
);
client.getbit('pings:2024-01-01-00:00', 456, (err, reply) =>
	console.log(reply)
);
```

**Performance**

- **Efficiency**: SETBIT and GETBIT operations are O(1), making them extremely fast.
- **BITOP**: O(n), where n is the length of the longest string involved in the operation.
- **Space Optimization**: Bitmaps allow significant memory savings compared to traditional data structures when storing sparse or boolean data.

Redis bitmaps provide a powerful way to handle boolean data efficiently, making them suitable for a wide range of applications where compact storage and fast operations are crucial.
